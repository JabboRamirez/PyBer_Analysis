# PyBer Written Analysis
Module 5

## Overview

Create a summary of the dataframe of the ride_sharing data by city. In addition, we created a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type to better vizualize these disparities and improve the Pyber app.

## Total rides

Urban cities have the most rides (1,625) and Rural cities have the least (125). Suburban cities are in the middle, with 625 rides. Urban cities have 5x as many rides as suburban cities and 13x more than rural cities.

## Total Drivers

Urban cities have the most drivers (2,405), followed by Suburban cities with 490 drivers and Rural cities with 78 drivers. Urban cities have 30x more drivers than Rural cities.

## Average Fare per Ride

Rural cities have the highest average Fare per Ride ($34.62) followed by Suburban cities ($30.97) and Urban cities ($24.53).

## Average Fare per Driver

Rural cities have the highest average Fare per Driver, over 3x as much as Urban cities ($16.57). Suburban cities are in the middle with $39.50 as the average fare per driver.

# Summary

My recommendations are as follows, increase the rural drivers too meet the demand. As the number of drivers in rural cities increases, then the average fare per driver will decrease, stabilizing the average fare per driver for rural cities. Finally, as these changes happen, the average Fare per ride for rural cities should go down and reduce the disparity between the city types.
